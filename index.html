            analysts. He has won the 'NBA Most Valuable Player Award' twice in a row, 
            including one unanimous win, a first in ‘NBA’ history.</p>

            to their first championship in four decades, and also helped his team break 
            the record for the most wins in an ‘NBA’ season.He earned the ‘Southern 
            Conference Player of the Year’ title twice by setting an all-time scoring 
            record for both ‘Davidson’ and the ‘Southern Conference.’ He also set the 
            ‘NCAA’ record for most three-pointers made in a season during his second 
            year in college. Renowned for his shooting skills, he holds the ‘NBA’ 
            record for most three-pointers made in a regular season, a record that 
            he himself broke twice. He and his teammate, Klay Thompson, are known                 by the nickname ‘Splash Brothers’ for their record-breaking combined 
            three-pointers in a season.</p>
